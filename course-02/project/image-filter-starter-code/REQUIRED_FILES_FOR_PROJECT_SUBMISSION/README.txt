The submission form didn't have blanks for submitting the Elastic
Beanstalk URL or the screen shot.  I see from the mentor Q&A section
that others have fallen into this same trap.  The instructions to
cancel the submission did not work; I started the cancellation
immediately after submitting, but the link said "View Submission", not
"Cancel Submission" as the instructions say.  Please fix the
instructions to make clearer how these required items should be
submitted!
